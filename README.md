# Voxel workflow
If using Avoyd, the models end up huge in both scale and in MBs. To resolve this, import to blender and scale it down to 0.04 (good enough approximation). Do not scale models in Avoyd as that changes the model.
You cannot import sprites bigger than 256x256 into MagicaVoxel. Resolved by cutting up the models into smaller ones (my prefered method) or importing using Avoyd.
If using avoyd, mesh optimization is needed https://www.enkisoftware.com/devlogpost-20230918-1-Optimising-Voxel-Meshes-for-Games-Using-Blender (atleast the first part where you merge by distance)
# Problems
Red in game looks like pink, not sure how to resolve.
