# SuperSoyCart

 We are soy back!

# Possible improvements that can be made

## Sprites/models

### Sprites

Roadtile sprite add more details
Fred complete rework 
Soy small improvement
Whatever you feel like you can improve

### Models

Road tile separate road and grass into it's own models

# Voxel workflow

I would recommend combination of MagicalVoxel and VoxEdit (MV for making initials models VE for putting them into composite models and exporting to .gltf). Also tried Goxel and Avoyd and they are both bad.

Export to .gltf.
If making car models each wheel needs to be separate object.

Careful with car model wheel rotation, all of them need to be rotated the exact same way otherwise car controls won't work properly.

VoxEdit to Godot you need to scale down karts by 50 times (1 to 0.02). This is needed for sane defaults in Godot.

# Problems

Red in game looks like pink, not sure how to resolve.

Oliver.glb is not perfectly centered but that is a very small issue not worth doing atm

# Finished tasks
